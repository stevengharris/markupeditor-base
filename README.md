# MarkupEditor

The MarkupEditor supports WYSIWYG editing in a web view. The "source of truth" for the MarkupEditor is standard HTML, styled using standard CSS.
The MarkupEditor comes with a toolbar and hot key bindings to access its editing functionality. The toolbar visibility and contents, 
as well as the key bindings, are configurable and extensible.

### Motivation

Like Markdown, the MarkupEditor keeps the focus on what you're writing, with a minimum of distractions. Like Markdown, it supports just enough 
functionality to help you organize and format your writing to get your points across effectively. Unlike Markdown, the MarkupEditor's WYSIWYG 
approach means you always see what you're writing presented properly as you write it, instead of dealing with the distractions of composing 
text with embedded notations and the uncertainty of how that text is later translated to HTML and presented.
