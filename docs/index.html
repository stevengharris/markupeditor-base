        <h1>Welcome to the MarkupEditor</h1>
        <p>
            The MarkupEditor supports WYSIWYG editing in a web view. The "source of truth" for the MarkupEditor is standard HTML, styled using standard 
            CSS. The MarkupEditor is available as a web component with a toolbar and hot key bindings to access its editing functionality. The toolbar 
            visibility and contents, as well as the key bindings, are configurable and extensible.
        </p>
        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>
            You or the consumers of your application need to edit more than just plain text. You want to be able to format and organize a document with 
            headers, lists, links, images, and perhaps tables, but you do not want to do that using Markdown or require that the consumers of your app know 
            anything about Markdown or HTML. The MarkupEditor is the solution. It can be used in any environment that supports a web view, from a browser 
            to a mobile or desktop app.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like Markdown, the MarkupEditor keeps the focus on what you're writing, with a minimum of distractions. Like Markdown, it supports just enough 
            functionality to help you organize and format your writing to get your points across effectively. Unlike Markdown, the MarkupEditor's WYSIWYG 
            approach means you always see what you're writing presented properly as you write it, instead of dealing with the distractions of composing 
            text with embedded notations and the uncertainty of how that text is later translated to HTML and presented.
        </p>

            <p>The MarkupEditor is available as a web component. In its simplest form:</p>
            <blockquote><pre><code>&lt;markup-editor>&lt;p>Hello, world!&lt;/p>&lt;/markup-editor>
&lt;script src="src/markup-editor.js">&lt;/script></code></pre></blockquote>
            <p>
                Optional &lt;markup-editor> element attributes provide extensive customization options and let you 
                load HTML content from file. The default MarkupEditor toolbar enables features to...
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Insert and edit links, images, and tables.</p></li>
                <li><p>Set paragraph styles.</p></li>
                <li><p>Add lists and indenting.</p></li>
                <li><p>Set text formatting.</p></li>
                <li><p>Search for text.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can customize the toolbar visibility, contents, ordering, and the hotkey mapping.</p>

            <li><p>
                <strong><a href="demo/index.html">MarkupEditor Demo</a></strong>. 
                Exercise all of the MarkupEditor features on a document containing all of the supported
                HTML elements. The demo includes a customized toolbar and the ability to watch the underlying 
                HTML update as you edit.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                <strong><a href="helloworld/index.html">Hello, world</a></strong>. 
                Every project needs a "Hello, world!" demo to highlight the simplest possible case. 
                Follow <a href="helloworld/content.html">this link</a> to see the page source or 
                "view source" in your browser to see what's required to present "Hello, world!" in 
                an editable HTML document.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                <strong><a href="webcomponent/index.html">Web Components</a></strong>. This demo shows 
                multiple &lt;markup-editor> web components on a single page, one using defaults, and the 
                other with a customized toolbar. It's a compact example of MarkupEditor customization.

        <h3>Code and Tools</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p>
                <strong><a href="https://github.com/stevengharris/markupeditor-base">Git repository</a></strong>.
                The "MarkupEditor base" project is used to support the demos, and is re-used by 
                several different WYSIWYG editor projects.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                <strong><a href="https://github.com/stevengharris/markupeditor-desktop">Desktop MarkupEditor</a></strong>.
                A desktop app version of the MarkupEditor, which also comes with a command line tool to open the 
                MarkupEditor on any file. You can edit, save, open other files, and create new files. The content 
                provided in the <a href="demo/index.html">Demo</a>, <a href="guide/index.html">Developer's Guide</a>,  
                and <a href="api/index.html">API</a> documents was all edited entirely using the MarkupEditor desktop app.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                <strong><a href="https://github.com/stevengharris/MarkupEditor">Swift MarkupEditor</a></strong>.
                Are you a Swift developer, looking for some of that WYSIWYG goodness? Check out 
                the Swift version. It re-uses the same MarkupEditor base project code loaded into 
                a <code>WKWebView</code>. It comes with Swift MarkupEditorView and MarkupEditorUIViews  
                that can be plugged into a SwiftUI or UIKit project, along with a SwiftUI-based toolbar.
                The Swift project has been in use for years with an earlier version of what is now 
                formalized in the base project.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                <strong><a href="https://github.com/stevengharris/markupeditor-vs">VSCode extension</a></strong>.
                Are you a VSCode user? One of the drivers for formalizing the MarkupEditor base project 
                was to use it in a VSCode extension. That project is under active development.
