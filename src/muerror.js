/**
 * MUError captures internal errors and makes it easy to communicate them externally.
 *
 * Usage is generally via the statics defined here, altho supplementary info can
 * be provided to the MUError instance when useful.
 *
 * Alert is set to true when the user might want to know an error occurred. Because
 * this is generally the case, it's set to true by default and certain MUErrors that
 * are more informational in nature are set to false.
 *
 * Note that there is at least one instance of the Swift side notifying its MarkupDelegate
 * of an error using this same approach, but originating on the Swift side. That happens
 * in MarkupWKWebView.copyImage if anything goes wrong, because the copying to the
 * clipboard is handled on the Swift side.
